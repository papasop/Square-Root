# 📐 Square Root Coupling Between Structure and Entropy: A Riemann Phase Perspective

This repository explores a deep coupling between **structural perturbation functions** derived from Riemann zeta zeros and the growth of entropy. Specifically, we find:

> $\phi(n) \sim \sqrt{H(n)}$, where $H(n) = \log(1 + \phi(n)^2)$  
> and the structural derivative ratio $K(n) = \frac{d\log |\phi(n)|}{d\log H(n)} \approx 0.5$.

These findings are built upon a novel interpretation of **Riemann zeros as geometric phase structures**, with implications for information theory, spectral geometry, and number theory.
